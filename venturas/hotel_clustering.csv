647,"Rm-f19 Hacienda Riquelme Golf Resort, 30590 Sucina Spain",Hacienda Riquelme Golf Resort,"Opened in 2007, Hacienda Riquelme Golf Resort is located in a pretty, rural, location in open countryside, between the village of Sucina and the mountains of Sierra de Carrascoy - an area which has been designated a regional natural park - in the Region of Murcia, in Spain. Yet it is just twenty minutes from the beach and airport. The buildings keep the charm of the area alive, such as the manor house, now fully restored as a clubhouse and town centre. The apartments look out over the Nicklaus designed golf course and retain the colonial style of the Riquelme family constructions. The family-friendly resort has wide, open spaces designed to give a sense of space, peace, and tranquillity, and to provide an experience of nature in all its glory. The resort is ideal to enjoy a walk or bike ride around and to admire the wildflowers, olive and orange trees, large lakes, and local scenery. The resort is an escape from the tourist trail (and the noisy bars), located in a serene setting, surrounded by olive groves, and magnificent views of the golf course. Imagine waking up after an undisturbed night's sleep on a super-comfortable mattress, and taking breakfast, on your terrace or balcony, facing the well-maintained gardens, listening only to the birdlife. The resort covers 1,353.041 m², and consists of 1864 privately owned apartments (all with free Wi-Fi), in 78 blocks, scattered around an 18 hole golf course, designed by Nicklaus Design - one of the golf courses, which make up the ""GNK Golf Trail"" in the region. The resort centre is based around the old Hacienda - a painstakingly restored, late-19th Century, colonial-style country house - previously belonging to the Riquelme family, which gives its name to the resort. The hacienda buildings have been meticulously restored to their former glory, to provide an authentic Spanish clubhouse, simply oozing with character, charm, and ambiance, which further enhances the experience that is Hacienda Riquelme. The rest of the resort centre follows the same architectural style and contains a café, restaurant, bar, golf shop, and supermarket. The old dovecote has been converted into a café, right on the golf course itself. The apartments were designed by Antonio Aleman Architects and supported by careful attention to landscape, developed by EDSA - the leading design company in America for tourist complexes. Hacienda Riquelme has 24-hour security patrols, entry control, and CCTV coverage, giving total peace of mind. As well as the beautifully maintained golf course, there are two tennis courts, two paddle tennis courts, an outside gym, six children’s play areas, and 19 swimming pools, serving all 78 apartment blocks. Largely still a very traditional Spanish area; the Costa Cálida is known as the ""warm coast"" - enjoying year-round sunshine and very little rain. The Region of Murcia has an excellent climate, with over 320 days sunshine per year, and warm winters, and is the ideal venue for year-round golf. But it is not just about the golf, many owners have bought apartments here because they love the sun, the views of the gardens and the golf course, and the 19 swimming pools. The village of Sucina is just a few minutes from the resort by car, which offers the basic services and facilities needed for everyday living. There are shops, banks, a post office, supermarkets, banks, opticians, a pharmacy and restaurants, including Spanish, Italian and Indian. The seaside town of Los Alcázares, with sandy beaches, shallow sea, and restaurants is about a 20-minute drive away. Balsicas railway station is 15 minutes away, with its high-speed train links to Murcia, Cartagena, Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia, etc. The resort has benefited from the building of Murcia's RM-1 motorway. This makes the resort much more accessible and allows residents and holidaymakers quick access to Sucina, the beach and airports. The resort is serviced by two regional airports - Corvera (RMU) a 20-minute drive away, and Alicante (ALC) about a 60-minute drive away. Both airports are easily reached via low-cost airlines from most UK airports. Car hire is available at the airports; there are plenty of taxis, or you can arrange private hire transfers,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1509165-d1228675-Reviews-Hacienda_Riquelme_Golf_Resort-Sucina.html?m=66827,37.896847,-0.970382,383,4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,2.0,"['Pool', 'Free parking', 'Internet', 'Wheelchair access', 'Restaurant', 'Kitchenette', 'Public Wifi', 'Free Wifi', 'Golf course', 'Tennis Court', 'Multilingual Staff', 'Self-Serve Laundry', 'Refrigerator in room', 'Private Balcony', 'Outdoor pool', 'Kids Activities', 'Free Internet', 'Bar/Lounge', 'Wifi', 'Non-smoking rooms', 'Air conditioning', 'Family Rooms', 'Accessible rooms', 'Microwave', 'Flatscreen TV', 'Kids pool', 'Breakfast Available', 'Facilities for Disabled Guests', 'Bath / Shower', 'Bicycle Rental', 'Bidet', 'Bowling', 'Bowling Off-site', 'Cable / Satellite TV', 'Canoeing Off-site', 'Coffee Shop', 'Coffee / Tea Maker', 'Dining Area', 'Dishwasher', 'Electric Kettle', 'English', 'Fence Around Pool', 'Happy Hour', 'Hiking', ""Kids' Meals"", 'Kitchenware', 'Mountain View', 'Outdoor Dining Area', 'Oven', 'Parking Garage', 'Patio', 'Picnic Area', 'Pool View', 'Seating Area', 'Secured Parking', 'Separate Dining Area', 'Separate Living Room', 'Shallow End', 'Shops', 'Snack Bar', 'Sofa', 'Spanish', 'Special Diet Menus', 'Street Parking', 'Sun Terrace', 'Telephone', 'Tennis Court Off-site', 'Walking Tours', 'Wardrobe / Closet', 'Washing Machine', 'Water Park Off-site', 'Wine / Champagne']",25
